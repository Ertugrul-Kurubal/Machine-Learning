A study is requested from you to predict which employee will churn by using this data.\r\n","\r\n","The HR dataset has 14,999 samples. In the given dataset, you have two types of employee one who stayed and another who left the company.\r\n","\r\n","You can describe 10 attributes in detail as:\r\n","- ***satisfaction_level:*** It is employee satisfaction point, which ranges from 0-1.\r\n","- ***last_evaluation:*** It is evaluated performance by the employer, which also ranges from 0-1.\r\n","- ***number_projects:*** How many of projects assigned to an employee?\r\n","- ***average_monthly_hours:*** How many hours in averega an employee worked in a month?\r\n","- **time_spent_company:** time_spent_company means employee experience. The number of years spent by an employee in the company.\r\n","- ***work_accident:*** Whether an employee has had a work accident or not.\r\n","- ***promotion_last_5years:*** Whether an employee has had a promotion in the last 5 years or not.\r\n","- ***Departments:*** Employee's working department/division.\r\n","- ***Salary:*** Salary level of the employee such as low, medium and high.\r\n","- ***left:*** Whether the employee has left the company or not.\r\n","\r\n","First of all, to observe the structure of the data, outliers, missing values and features that affect the target variable, you must use exploratory data analysis and data visualization techniques. \r\n","\r\n","Then, you must perform data pre-processing operations such as ***Scaling*** and ***Label Encoding*** to increase the accuracy score of Gradient Descent Based or Distance-Based algorithms. you are asked to perform ***Cluster Analysis*** based on the information you obtain during exploratory data analysis and data visualization processes. \r\n","\r\n","The purpose of clustering analysis is to cluster data with similar characteristics. You are asked to use the ***K-means*** algorithm to make cluster analysis. However, you must provide the K-means algorithm with information about the number of clusters it will make predictions. Also, the data you apply to the K-means algorithm must be scaled. In order to find the optimal number of clusters, you are asked to use the ***Elbow method***. Briefly, try to predict the set to which individuals are related by using K-means and evaluate the estimation results.\r\n","\r\n","Once the data is ready to be applied to the model, you must ***split the data into train and test***.

Train your models with your train set, test the success of your model with your test set. \r\n","\r\n","Try to make your predictions by using the algorithms ***Gradient Boosting Classifier***, ***K Neighbors Classifier***, ***Random Forest Classifier***. You can use the related modules of the ***scikit-learn*** library. You can use scikit-learn ***Confusion Metrics*** module for accuracy calculation. You can use the ***Yellowbrick*** module for model selection and visualization.\r\n","\r\n","In the final step, you will deploy your model using Streamlit tool.\r\n","\r\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4oRnVXpS2slN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# #Tasks\n","\n","#### 1.

The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters in k-means clustering. The elbow method plots the value of the cost function produced by different values of k. If k increases, average distortion will decrease, each cluster will have fewer constituent instances, and the instances will be closer to their respective centroids. However, the improvements in average distortion will decline as k increases. The value of k at which improvement in distortion declines the most is called the elbow, at which we should stop dividing the data into further clusters.\n","\n","    [The Elbow Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)\n","\n","    [The Elbow Method2](https://medium.com/@mudgalvivek2911/machine-learning-clustering-elbow-method-4e8c2b404a5d)\n","\n","    [KMeans](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-k-means-clustering-in-machine-learning-6a6e67336aa1)\n","\n","Let's find out the groups of employees who left.
